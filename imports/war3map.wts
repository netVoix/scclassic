{
You get some gold passively. Your fortress can generate gold with its HP upgrade. Neutral buildings generate gold and also grant other special and unique bonuses. Neutral buildings can be captured by |cff00ffffHero|r or |cff00ffffSiege Unit|r when there are no enemy units nearby (Capturing building for the first time gives bonus gold). Gold income from neutral building is reduced if players that are close to it are destroyed. Their special bonuses are increased in the same way. |nList of Neutral Buildings: |n|cffffff00Gold Mine|r - gives more gold over time |n|cff00ffffLumber Mill|r - increases building HP regeneration |n|cffff0000War Mill|r - increases unit damage |n|cff00ff00Forge|r - increases unit armor |n|cff00ff00Stone Quarry|r - increases building armor |n|cffff0000Marketplace|r - increases Hero damage/armor |n|cffff0000Tavern|r - increases unit attack rate |n|cffff00ffGoblin Laboratory|r - reduces enemy armor |n|cff00ffffFountain of Mana|r - increases building mana regeneration |n|cffff00ffSacrificial Altar|r - reduces enemy damage |n|cffff0000Workshop|r - increases building damage |n|cffffff00Metal Mine|r - gives more gold over time
